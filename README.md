# Testing the effect of a price increase on Company XYZâ€™s revenue

(This work is originally a mock data challenge completed as part of the 2020A Boston Insight Data Science Fellows Program. This work was finished within 4 hours limit. )

## Executive Summary
The goal of this project is to generate insights from an A/B testing running on the site for a software product. The responses of these customers, as well as those of a control group shown the normal software price, were recorded along with some other information over a period of three months.

### Key questions addressed by this project:

* What is the impact on conversion rate due to increasing the price of the software?
* What is the impact on revenue due to increasing the price of the software?
* Can A/B testing be made more efficient in the future? Could we have stopped collecting data earlier being able to get statistically significant results?

### The project is organized into several sections:

* Load Datasets
* Data Processing and Cleaning
* EDA
* Testing differences between control group and test group
* Conclusion and key insights
